# **_Quiz_**

Quiz is an app where you can test your knowledge about the world. This is a useful game for broadening one's horizons. This app looks just as simple questionnaire. There are multiple answers for each question. But only one is right. I create this app because I want to learn new technologies like React, TypeScript etc.
